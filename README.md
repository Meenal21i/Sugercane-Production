# Sugercane-Production
### Performed EDA on dataset of sugercane production all over the world 

### first of sll we cleaned the data, if we haven't cleaned the data, then it would be impossible for us to analze the data.
### Next we solved that how many countries produce sugarcane from each continent.
### Then we found out which continent has maximum countries using Bar Graph.
### then we checked the distribution of columns and we found out that first 3 columns have skewed distribution, yield_per_kg does not have.
### Because of the skewed distribution we have outliers in the first 3 columns and the fourth one does not have.  
### also these outliers are important because these are giving us maximum value that in which country we have maximum production, etc

### Next we moved to bivariate analysis which helps us to find out - 
### Which country produces maximum sugarcane, we plotted using a pie chart that 65% of the overall production has done by Brazil, India & China 
### also plotted using bar graph
### next we found out which country has maximum land, highest yield per hectare, highest prod
### then we found the correlation between all the numerical columns, found out that produvtion(tons) does not depend on the yield(kg/hectare) but it does depends on acerage(hectare)
### solved all the questions for continent as well.
